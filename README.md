# phase1-project

This project will be used as a library database for those that want 
to keep track of their vintage vinyl collection!

## Setup 

Run this command to get the backend started: 

"json-server --watch db.json"

## Output

The base project will pull from a database of five of our personally 
owned vinyls but obviously the user will have free range to add or remove their own vinyls from the library!
